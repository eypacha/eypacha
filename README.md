# Hi, I'm Ey Pacha! 
**Second-generation clown, magician and kindergarten teacher** (and then... a programmer)

<a href="https://eypacha.com"><img src="https://eypacha.com/img/0.jpg"></a>

🎹 From an early age, I began studying **piano and guitar** with several teachers and I continued studying at the Conservatory

👶 I'm graduated as a **Kindergarten teacher**, professional title with which he had work eight years in several schools.

🎪 I travel around the world with **my one-man show** breaking language barriers by speaking without words 

📖 I promote **self-education**, with which he learned to play  musical instruments, origami, beatboxing, solve a Rubik's Cube, a lot of magic, playing yoyo, maths... and I almost forgot: **programming!**

💻 I like to write code, using **programming as an artistic tool**. Sometimes I work for others but I enjoy more facing my own projects.
