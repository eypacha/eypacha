# Hi, I'm Ey Pacha! 👋🏽
**Creative programmer, clown, magician and musician**

💻 I like to write code, using **programming as an artistic tool**. Sometimes I work for others but I enjoy more facing my own projects.

🌐 With experience in frontend and full stack development, I specialize in technologies such as JavaScript (Vue.js and React), CSS (Sass, Tailwind, Bootstrap), Node.js, Laravel, and possess solid knowledge in databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.

🚀 Currently, I develop software for small and medium-sized companies focusing on code quality inspired by the Joel Test and continual improvement with an agile approach.
